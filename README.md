## With more time...
Problems I ran into so far were mostly regarding formatting the rechart. With more time I would look to solve the duplicate month bug with a state hook that stores months used and then checks new ones against ones already used. I would use the tickFormatter API in recharts to solve this.

Responsiveness would be my next task as the page currently only works on desktop.
